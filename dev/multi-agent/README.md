# multi-agent (Dev-only)

This directory contains development-only artifacts for the `multi-agent` skill (tests, fixtures, and methodology docs). It is intentionally kept **outside** the installable skill directory so installations do not include test content.

## Quick smoke

From the repo root:

```sh
python3 dev/multi-agent/e2e/run_smoke.py
```

## Docs

- Methodology: `dev/multi-agent/PROTOCOL_TESTING.md`
- Fixtures: `dev/multi-agent/e2e/`
